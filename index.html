    <h2>WEB이란 무엇인가?</h2>
    <p>WebCite is an on-demand archive site, designed to digitally preserve scientific and educationally important material on the web by making snapshots of Internet contents as they existed at the time when a blogger or a scholar cited or quoted from it. The preservation service enables verifiability of claims supported by the cited sources even when the original web pages are being revised, removed, or disappear for other reasons, an effect known as link rot.</p><p> Sometime between 9 and 17 July 2019, WebCite stopped accepting new archiving requests.[2] As of February 2021, it does not accept new archiving requests, but continues to serve existing archives. As of 19 August 2021, there was a maintenance announcement, and no archived content was accessible; WebCite came back online sometime between then and 8 October 2021.</p>
